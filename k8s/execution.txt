## ✅ APPLY (Deploy) Sequence

### 0) Create namespace first

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/namespace.yml
```

### 1) Secrets + ConfigMaps

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/secrets/
kubectl apply -f k8s/configmaps/
```

### 2) MySQL (PVC + Deployment + Service)

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/mysql/
```

### 3) Backend (Deployment + Service)

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/backend/
```

### 4) Frontend (Deployment + Service)

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/frontend/
```

### 5) Ingress (last)

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/ingress/
```

---

## ✅ Verify after apply

```bash
kubectl get all -n reviewed
kubectl get pods -n reviewed -w
kubectl get svc -n reviewed
kubectl get ingress -n reviewed
```

# ❌ DELETE (Cleanup) Sequence

Ingress first, then app deployments/services, then DB, then config.

### 1) Delete ingress

```bash
kubectl delete -f k8s/ingress/
```

### 2) Delete frontend

```bash
kubectl delete -f k8s/frontend/
```

### 3) Delete backend

```bash
kubectl delete -f k8s/backend/
```

### 4) Delete mysql

```bash
kubectl delete -f k8s/mysql/
```

### 5) Delete configmaps + secrets

```bash
kubectl delete -f k8s/configmaps/
kubectl delete -f k8s/secrets/
```

### 6) Delete namespace (deletes everything inside it)

```bash
kubectl delete -f k8s/namespace.yml
```

## ⭐ One-liner (Apply everything at once)

Only use this if all YAMLs are correct and structured properly:

```bash
kubectl apply -f k8s/
```

## ⭐ One-liner delete (Danger but clean)

```bash
kubectl delete -f k8s/
```

If you paste your exact folder structure (`k8s/...`) I can give you the **exact commands matching your filenames**.
